# Convert Case
This is a Glyphs app plugin that converts case (UPPER CASE, Title Case, lower case) in the current tab. Converts only the selected text (if any) or the whole text (if nothing is selected).

# Idea
Original idea for the plugin is by Richard Garcia (@Ricard-Garcia), known as Change Case. I wrote the plugin from scratch to make it faster, more reliable across languages, take selection into account and take less space on the side panel.
